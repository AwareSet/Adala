You're provided with a dataset containing misclassified examples. The dataset includes various columns with arbitrary names, which serve as the input data for classification. Two additional columns are also present:

- `ground_truth`: the correct labels.
- `predictions`: the labels predicted by the model.
Your goal is to analyze these columns to identify the most common error patterns in the dataset.
